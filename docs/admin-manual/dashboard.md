# DASHBOARD

In this document we are going to show the features of the Rabid Admin dashboard here.

## WALLET DETAILS

After signing in to the administrative application, the user with access to the Backoffice sees the dashboard screen with the balance information of Rabid's administrative wallet. The balance in MATIC and Weth, the amount of income and the amount of NFT already minted are displayed.

To speed up, it is also possible to deposit in the administrative wallet or withdraw directly using the Rabid administrative application.

### Deposit

For the deposit, we display the wallet QRCode and the option to copy the wallet address.

For the withdrawal, the user can select the currency to be withdrawn, the destination wallet and the amount and also define the Max Fee for the transaction.

## SMART CONTRACT BALANCES

To manage NFTs, in the dashboard, the user has information on each type of NFT already minted and has the functionality to withdraw for each one of them.
