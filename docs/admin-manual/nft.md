At the bottom of the page, the transaction hash is also displayed as a link, just click on the link and PolygonScan opens in another tab with the hash filtered. 

This link is not stored, so when leaving the page it is lost. But when accessing PolygonScan and filtering by the address of the administrative platform, it is possible to view the transactions.

The minted NFT is possible to BURN or APPROVE. After approving the NFT, it is available to publish on the marketplace listing to be available for sale.
